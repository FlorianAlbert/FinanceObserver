# FinanceObserver

This is a learning project aiming to develop a platform to observe your finances and everything around it. 

## Description

The main purpose of this project is to inspect, test and learn different technologies in a practical context.

The application domain centers around the management of private financials and other financial topics with several possibilities to extend it in related areas.

For now, the project only consists of an [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) backend, backed by a [PosgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and a ([MailDev](https://maildev.github.io/maildev/)) development SMTP Server. Plans are to extend it by a release profile with a production ready SMTP Server and by different UI clients based on different technology stacks.

Contributions are always welcome! ü§ù
